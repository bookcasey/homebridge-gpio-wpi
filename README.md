# Homebridge GPIO WiringPi

Supports triggering General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi.

Based on [homebrige-gpio](https://github.com/jamesblanksby/homebridge-gpio)
Uses wiringPi as a back end to give non-root access to GPIO.

## Requirements
-	[Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) - _HomeKit support for the impatient_
-	[wiring-pi](https://github.com/eugeneware/wiring-pi) - _Node.js bindings to wiringPi_

## Installation
1.	Install Homebridge using `npm install -g homebridge`
2.	Install this plugin `npm install -g homebridge-gpio-wpi`
3.	Update your configuration file - see `sample-config.json` in this repo

## Configuration
Example `config.json`

```json
{
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "MyGPIO",
        "name": "GPIO2",
        "pin": 27,
        "duration": 4000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pin Configuration
You need to configure the relevant GPIO pins using the gpio tool included with wiringPi.

 The pin number specified in the config.json file is the BCM pin number in this table.

 When configuring the pins using GPIO, you can use the -g option to avoid confusion!

 $ gpio -g mode 27 out   <-- Set OUTput mode
 $ gpio -g mode 27 down  <-- Set pull-down resistor
 $ gpio export 27 out    <-- Export the pin to /sys/class/gpio

 The gpio tool is setuid root, so should be run as the user that runs Homebridge.
